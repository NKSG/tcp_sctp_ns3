This project aims at implementing the TCP functionalties of
SCTP like Flow Control, Error Control and Congestion control along with
the four way handshake and the event notification in NS-3.

Currently SCTP is not implemented in NS-3 and it is important to imple-
ment SCTP in NS-3 since it forms the underlying transport for S1 Signalling
Transport.
